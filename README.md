# This was a game i first started programming years ago in python, and every once in a while i would make a new version of it
# At one point i ended up working on it as a group with some friends but we eventually stopped working on it since it was taking up too much time around exam time
# Once i started college and began learning VB, i immediatly started making a new version of the game but in VB.
# This is why the game is written like ass bc i started making it whilst i was learning VB but here we are

# This game was inspired by DnD (as i had jus tstarted playing it around the time i first made the game)
#Enjoy!
